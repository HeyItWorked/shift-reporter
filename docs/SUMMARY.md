## 🎯 How to Use

### For Development Workflow

**Week-by-week approach:**
```
Week 0: Start → sprint-0-setup.md
Week 1-2: Implement → sprint-1-log-parser.md
Week 3-4: Implement → sprint-2-ui-display.md
Week 5-6: Implement → sprint-3-outlook-contacts.md
Week 7-8: Implement → sprint-4-training.md
Week 9-10: Implement → sprint-5-polish.md
```

**Feature-focused approach:**
```
Need to understand a feature? → /features/ folder
Need implementation steps? → /sprints/ folder
Need architecture info? → ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### For Project Planning

1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Share with stakeholders
2. **Sprint files** - Use for sprint planning meetings
3. **Feature files** - Reference during implementation
4. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical design decisions

## 💡 Key Improvements

### ✅ Better Organization
- Each sprint has its own file (not one massive file)
- Features documented separately from implementation
- Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ Easier Navigation
- NAVIGATION.md provides complete guide
- Cross-references between files
- Find information by role, topic, or sprint

### ✅ Better for Development
- Open just the sprint you're working on
- Reference feature docs when needed
- Track progress per file

### ✅ Version Control Friendly
- Smaller files = clearer git diffs
- Can track changes per sprint
- Easier to review pull requests

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start Here:** Open [docs/NAVIGATION.md](NAVIGATION.md)
2. **Get Oriented:** Read [docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
3. **Begin Development:** Follow [docs/sprints/sprint-0-setup.md](sprints/sprint-0-setup.md)

---

## 📝 Notes

- Original files (`README.md` and `sprint-planning.md`) are still in the root folder
- You can keep them as reference or archive them
- All new documentation is in `/docs/` folder
- Each file is self-contained but cross-referenced

**Happy building! 🎉**
