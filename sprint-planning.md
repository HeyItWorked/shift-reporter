| COM Interop complexity            | Medium      | High   | Test early, have fallback (mailto:)    |
| Mock data doesn't match real logs | Medium      | Medium | Get real sample early if possible      |

## üìù Notes for Success

### Tips for Solo Development

1. **Don't skip ceremonies** - Even solo, sprint planning keeps you organized
2. **Track your time** - Know how long things actually take
3. **Take breaks** - Code quality drops when tired
4. **Commit often** - Small, frequent commits are safer
5. **Document as you go** - Don't wait until end
6. **Test continuously** - Don't let bugs accumulate
7. **Celebrate wins** - Reward yourself at sprint milestones!

### When You Get Stuck

1. Check documentation (Microsoft Docs, Stack Overflow)
2. Simplify the problem (build incrementally)
3. Ask for help (forums, Discord communities)
4. Take a break (walk away, come back fresh)
5. Skip and move on (come back to it later)

### Adjusting the Plan

**Too Fast?**

* Add "nice to have" features from backlog
* Improve test coverage
* Refactor for code quality
* Add more polish

**Too Slow?**

* Move stories to later sprint
* Reduce scope of current stories
* Simplify implementation
* Focus on MVP features only
